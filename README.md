### Final project: Mapping reward- and loss-related brain activity and effects of reward context
In this course, I analyzed fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to examine how monetary rewards and losses are represented in the brain. You can find an overview of the project and results in [this slide deck](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d7920c979e919f2be8f1e6e192ed78b715b10781/nma-project-slides.pdf). <br>
A notebook containing code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d42f91d484d0c6091ac733740b3f8eec1035f35b/NMA_project.ipynb).
